UPPGIFT  

AB VOLVO Volvo Energy is Volvo Group’s newest business area, dedicated to accelerating the Group’s electrification and sustainability journey. We do this by supporting the Volvo Group brands in sales and services of electrified vehicles & machines and creating an attractive and sustainable circular business model including second life batteries. 

AV2: A battery energy storage system (BESS) installed at commercial or industrial site can create many different values. These include 

(i) reducing power peaks of the site which in turn reduces grid congestion and demand charges for the customer, 

(ii) energy optimization, e.g. buying electricity when electricity is cheapest or has lowest CO2 intensity, 

(iii) maximizing use of local energy production, e.g. storing solar energy from mid-day to evening, 

(iv) energy arbitrage, i.e. buying and selling energy during the day to add revenue, 

(v) grid service participation, i.e. taking part in the Transmission System Operator’s grid frequency control market and 

(vi) provide back-up power to the site. 
 
Questions to be addressed include: With power(t) data provided for a specific site combined with assumptions in market prices for e.g. electricity, develop an optimization algorithm which can be used to maximizes the financial and/or environmental potential of a BESS installation. Follow-up questions include: How can it be improved by including e.g. weather forecasts? Or historical data? How to manage intra-day disturbances?
